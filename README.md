# wisecube

`wisecube` is an open-source platform for scalable, end-to-end knowledge graph construction from unstructured and structured data. The platform takes a collection of documents, extracts mentions and relations to populate a raw knowledge graph, links mentions to entities in Wikidata, and then enriches the knowledge graph with facts from Wikidata.
See [`wisecube.ai`](http://wisecube.ai/) for an overview of the platform.

 
This README provies instructions on how to replicate our work.
