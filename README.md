# wisecube

`wisecube` is an open-source library for scalable, end-to-end knowledge graph construction from unstructured and structured data. The spark-based library takes a collection of documents, extracts mentions and relations to populate a raw knowledge graph, links mentions to entities in Wikidata, and then enriches the knowledge graph with facts from Wikidata.
See [`wisecube.org`](http://www.wisecube.org/) for an overview of the library.

 
This README provies instructions on how to use the library in your own project.
